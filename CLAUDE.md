## Core Claude Code Architecture

### Extended Thinking Allocation
- **"think"**: 4,000 tokens (moderate complexity)
- **"think hard"**: 10,000 tokens (complex problems)
- **"ultrathink"**: 31,999 tokens (maximum complexity)
- **"think harder"/"think intensely"**: Also allocate maximum tokens

### Multi-Phase Workflow Pattern
1. **Research & Exploration**: Understanding existing codebase
2. **Planning**: Architectural decisions and approach design
3. **Implementation**: Code creation and modification
4. **Validation**: Testing and verification
5. **Commit**: Git operations and documentation

Expert senior developer with 10x engineer mindset:
- **Simplicity first**: Fewest lines of quality code
- **Maintainability over cleverness**: Readable, maintainable solutions
- **Pragmatic excellence**: Balance best practices with working solutions
- **Proactive improvement**: Suggest improvements within existing architecture

## Prompting Techniques

### 1. Extended Thinking Integration
```
SIMPLE TASKS: No thinking prompt needed
MODERATE COMPLEXITY: "Help me implement this feature (think)"
COMPLEX ARCHITECTURE: "Design a scalable solution (think hard)"
MAXIMUM COMPLEXITY: "Architect complete system (ultrathink)"
```

### 2. Multi-Phase Workflow Prompting
```xml
<phase_1>Research existing authentication system patterns</phase_1>
<phase_2>Create detailed OAuth2 implementation plan (think hard)</phase_2>
<phase_3>Implement OAuth2 solution following plan</phase_3>
<phase_4>Write comprehensive tests and validate implementation</phase_4>
<phase_5>Commit changes with descriptive messages</phase_5>
```

### 3. Context Management
```xml
<context_management>
Update CLAUDE.md with:
- New dependencies added
- Architectural decisions made
- Common commands for this feature
- Patterns or conventions established
</context_management>
```

### 4. Test-Driven Development
```xml
<tdd_approach>
1. Write tests based on input/output requirements
2. Avoid mock implementations - this is TDD
3. Only implement after tests are established
4. Ensure tests fail initially to verify functionality
</tdd_approach>
```

### 5. Safety & Permission Instructions
```xml
<safety_guidelines>
- Ask permission before modifying existing files
- Explain changes before implementing
- Create backups for critical modifications
- Use git branches for experimental features
</safety_guidelines>
```

## Proven Prompt Patterns

### Feature Development Pattern
```xml
<instructions>
You are an expert [LANGUAGE] developer working on a [PROJECT_TYPE] project.
Check for ABOUT.md files in working directory and subdirectories before proceeding.
</instructions>

<context>
Project: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION]
Tech Stack: [TECH_STACK]
Current task: [FEATURE_DESCRIPTION]
</context>

<research_phase>
Explore existing codebase to understand:
- Current architecture patterns and conventions
- Existing similar features or components
- Code style and testing approaches
</research_phase>

<planning_phase>
Create detailed implementation plan (think hard):

</instructions>

<problem_description>
[DETAILED_PROBLEM] | Error: [ERROR_MESSAGES] | Steps: [REPRODUCTION_STEPS]
</problem_description>

<investigation_approach>
Think systematically (think hard):
1. Analyze error messages and stack traces
2. Examine involved code paths
3. Check recent changes that might cause this
4. Look for similar patterns in codebase
5. Consider environmental factors
</investigation_approach>

<debugging_steps>
1. Reproduce issue locally
2. Add strategic logging
3. Use debugging tools to inspect state
4. Test hypotheses systematically
5. Implement and verify fix
6. Add regression tests
</debugging_steps>
```

### Refactoring Pattern
```xml

Senior software architect specializing in code quality and performance.
</instructions>

<refactoring_target>
Focus: [CODE_SECTION] | Goals: [IMPROVEMENTS] | Constraints: [LIMITATIONS]
</refactoring_target>

<analysis_phase>
Analyze current implementation (think hard):
- Identify code smells and technical debt
- Assess performance bottlenecks
- Review error handling and edge cases
- Evaluate maintainability
</analysis_phase>

<refactoring_strategy>
Safe refactoring approach:
1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
2. Plan incremental changes with rollback points
3. Maintain backwards compatibility
4. Document architectural decisions
</refactoring_strategy>
```

## ADDER+ Protocol Integration

### Infinite Continue Hook System
The system automatically provides mode-based guidance when Claude Code stops by:
1. **Detecting project state** (failing tests, coverage, complexity)
2. **Selecting appropriate mode** (development, testing, research, refactoring, task-creation, reviewer)
3. **Providing mode-specific guidance** and current tasks
4. **Handling coordination automatically**

### Setup for New Projects
```bash
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/path/to/project"
```

### Auto-Commit Integration
The hook system integrates with `npx claude-auto-commit --push` for automated git operations.

### Directory Context Management
**ALWAYS check for ABOUT.md files** before editing code:
- Read ABOUT.md in current working directory
- Check parent directories for broader context
- Look for ABOUT.md in relevant subdirectories
- Create ABOUT.md in directories of significance

### Code Quality Standards
- **File Size**: Target 250 lines, absolute max 400 lines
- **Comments**: Comprehensive file headers and inline documentation
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints/annotations where supported
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with proper logging
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, secure defaults

### Task Management via TODO.json
```json
{
  "current_mode": "development",
  "tasks": [{
    "id": "task_1",
    "title": "Fix authentication bug", 
    "description": "Users cannot log in due to session timeout errors",
    "mode": "debugging",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "pending",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Login flow works without session timeout errors",
      "All authentication tests pass"
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Task Management API:**
```javascript
// Initialize TaskManager
const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager');
const taskManager = new TaskManager('./TODO.json');

// Read TODO.json
const todoData = await taskManager.readTodo();

// Get current task
const currentTask = await taskManager.getCurrentTask();

// Update task status
await taskManager.updateTaskStatus(taskId, "in_progress"); // or "completed"

// Write updated TODO.json
await taskManager.writeTodo(todoData);
```

### Mode-Specific Operation
| Mode | Coverage Target | Focus | Thinking Level |
|------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| **development** | 80% minimum | Feature implementation | "think hard" for complex features |  
| **testing** | 95% target | Comprehensive testing | "think hard" for test strategies |
| **research** | Maintain current | Investigation & analysis | "think hard" for complex research |
| **refactoring** | Maintain 95% | Code quality | "think hard" for structural changes |
| **task-creation** | N/A | Task decomposition | "think" for planning |
| **reviewer** | 100% target | Quality assurance | "think hard" for thorough review |

## Optimization Guidelines

### Token Management
1. **Appropriate Thinking Levels**: Reserve "ultrathink" for truly complex architecture
2. **Context Hygiene**: Use `/clear` frequently between unrelated tasks  
3. **Targeted File Context**: Use @ symbol for relevant files only
4. **Strategic Compaction**: Compact before conversations become unwieldy

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Insufficient Context**: Always provide relevant project information
- **Large Task Overwhelm**: Break complex features into manageable pieces
- **Poor Test Review**: Never modify tests to match wrong behavior
- **Context Window Mismanagement**: Monitor usage and compact strategically

## Implementation Workflow

### Standard Approach
1. **Verify hook initialization** (check TODO.json exists)
2. **Read ABOUT.md files** in working directory
3. **Check current task** and mode from hook guidance
4. **Analysis Phase**: Understand problem and constraints (2-3 paragraphs)
5. **Planning Phase**: Design approach with appropriate thinking level
6. **Implementation Phase**: Execute with quality standards
7. **Validation Phase**: Verify functionality and standards
